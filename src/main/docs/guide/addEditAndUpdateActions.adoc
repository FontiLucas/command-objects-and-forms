Next, let's add the ability to update existing players. Add `edit` and `update` actions
to `PlayerController`. You should notice that these are almost the same as the `create`
and `save` actions.

[source,groovy]
----
    def edit(Player player) {
        respond player
    }

    def update(Player player) {
        if (player == null) {
            render status: HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND
            return
        }

        if (player.hasErrors()) {
            respond player.errors, view: 'edit'
            return
        }

        player.save flush: true

        request.withFormat {
            form multipartForm { redirect player }
            '*' { respond player, status: HttpStatus.OK }
        }
    }
----

The `edit` action starts with a `Player` command object; Grails fetches an existing `Player`
object automatically, and the properties of that object are loaded as the initial values of
the form in `edit.gsp`. The `update` action is the same as `save`, except that errors redirect
back to `edit` rather than `create`, and the HTTP status for success is `OK` rather than `CREATED`.

On the assumption that a player's win and loss counts will be managed elsewhere, the wins
and losses fields have already been removed from the form in `edit.gsp`.
While running the application, go to the player list and click on one of the
player names. While you can show the win/loss count, clicking the *Edit* button will
display a form that does not let you change the win/loss counts.

But this isn't sufficient: removing input fields from the form *does not prevent* those fields
from being changed. A clever user can submit the form by other means that will change those values.

[source]
----
$ curl --request GET "http://localhost:8080/player/show/1.json"

{"id":1, "game":"Pandemic", "losses":30, "name":"Alexis Barnett", "region":"EAST", "wins":96}

$ curl --request POST --form "id=1" --form "wins=2" --form "losses=194" "http://localhost:8080/player/update.json"
----

After the second `curl` command, player Alexis Barnett will have only two wins and 194 losses,
rather than the 96 wins and 30 losses she should have.

One way to fix this would be to avoid the use of the `Player` command object (so as to avoid
automatic filling of properties) and instead manage all of the loading, binding, and verification
manually. You could customize the action's behavior and ignore any attempts to modify the wins
and losses properties.

But command objects are not required to be a domain class: use any class! Define the following
class in `PlayerController.groovy` below the `PlayerController` class. Note that the property
names of `PlayerInfo` match those of the form's `<input>` tags; when the form is submitted,
form values will be bound to the command object's properties where the names match.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy[tags=playerInfo]
----

Change the `update` action to use `PlayerInfo` as the command object. Load the appropriate
`Player` instance, then update and save it using the command object's properties.

[source,groovy]
----
    def update(PlayerInfo info) {
        Player player = Player.get(params.id)
        if (player == null) {
            render status: HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND
            return
        }

        player.properties = info.properties
        player.save flush: true

        if (player.hasErrors()) {
            respond player.errors, view: 'edit'
            return
        }

        request.withFormat {
            form multipartForm { redirect player }
            '*' { respond player, status: HttpStatus.OK }
        }
    }
----

Since `PlayerInfo` does *not* contain `wins` or `losses`, those values will not be
accepted from the form submission, even if values are submitted for those names.

[source]
----
$ curl --request GET "http://localhost:8080/player/show/4.json"

{"id":4, "name":"Catherine Newton", "game":"Scythe", "region":"WEST", "wins":66, "losses":40}

$ curl --request POST --form "id=4" --form "name=June Smith" --form "game=Chess" --form "region=NORTH" --form "wins=0" --form "losses=10" "http://localhost:8080/player/update.json"

$ curl --request GET "http://localhost:8080/player/show/4.json"

{"id":4, "name":"June Smith", "game":"Chess", "region":"NORTH", "wins":66, "losses":40}
----

Note that the `name`, `game`, and `region` properties have all updated, but the `wins` and
`losses` properties have not changed despite our efforts to do so. By using the
`PlayerInfo` command object, we've restricted what fields are accepted from the form
submission.

Create a Unit Test to validate this behaviour

[source,groovy]
./src/test/groovy/demo/PlayerControllerSpec.groovy

<1> Call a no argument version of the update method. Put the values in the `params` map. Databinding
will map those values to the Command Object. This emulates what happens at runtime.

The current solution is lacking, though. Because `PlayerInfo` is now the command object and
not `Player`, validation is not done until the call to `player.save`. It would be better if
validation was done earlier, as it had been done when `Player` was the command object.

To resolve this, add a `constraints` block to `PlayerInfo`. When you defined the command
object class `PlayerInfo` in the `PlayerController.groovy` file, Grails recognized it as
a related command object class and made the class able to be validated. Change `PlayerInfo`
and add constraints.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy[tags=playerInfo;playerInfo-constraints]
----

Create a unit test to validate the constraints defined in the command object.

[source,groovy]
./src/test/groovy/demo/PlayerInfoSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/groovy/demo/PlayerInfoSpec.groovy[indent=0]
----


Revise the `update` action once more, returning error checking prior to the attempt to save.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy[tags=update]
----

Command object classes can be defined elsewhere (for example, under the `src/` folder hierarchy).
They need not be in the same file as the controller using them. This might be useful to maintain
a separation of concerns, or simply to make a command object class available to multiple controllers.

**If your command object class is defined in the same source file as the controller using it, Grails
will automatically make it `Validateable`, permitting the use of a static `constraints` block. If
you define the class elsewhere and need `constraints`, you need to add an `implements` clause** as displayed next:

[source,groovy]
----
class PlayerInfo implements grails.validation.Validateable {
    String name
    String game
    String region

    static constraints = {
        name blank: false
        game blank: false
        region nullable: true
    }
}
