As described in the http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#commandObjects[Grails documentation],
____
A command object is a class that is used in conjunction with data binding, usually to
allow validation of data that may not fit into an existing domain class. *A class is only
considered to be a command object when it is used as a parameter of an action.*
____

While a domain class *can* be used as a command object, so also can non-domain classes defined
in other files (or even classes defined in the same file as the controller using the class).
